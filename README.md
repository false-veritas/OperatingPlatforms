# OperatingPlatforms

The Gaming Room would like their current game, Draw It or Lose It, to be developed as a web-based game that is available on multiple platforms. This game is currently only
available as an Android app only. We took the role of a company that will develop this game as a web-based game as well as available on Android and iPhone marketplaces. Draw It
or Lose It is a game loosely similar to a 1980s TV game Win, Lose or Draw, where teams compete to guess what is being drawn. The game will contain a library of stocked images to 
use for players to guess where each image will be rendered at a steady rate and fully complete at 30 seconds. If the guessing team does not guess the image within 15 seconds,
remaining teams have an opportunity to offer one guess each and solve puzzle in the remaining 15 seconds. 

For this project I felt I did the design constraints particularly well. I was really considering outside of the box ideas for it such as the pre-existing intellectual property
constraint. When writing the code, the Domain Model and UML Diagram really helped the most. Basing the code off these really made it easier to understand what exactly is being
asked for and what information doesn’t need to be there. When you understand the Domain Model and UML Diagram you get the idea of how to write the code.  If I had to choose one
part to revise it would be the software evaluation. I already did revise it after instructor comments, but I feel like I misunderstood what exactly needed to be put in that 
section. What I did was add the advantages and disadvantages in a much more concise and straightforward manner to what information I already had there. 

When creating this software design, I looked at it from my own perspective. What would I like to see from a game such as this and how should it be made so that I would like to 
play it as well? You must consider basic quality of life needs that every game must have that attracts players to it. Easy to understand, runs smoothly, doesn’t take a lot to run
it, etc. It is important to consider user needs because if the user’s needs aren’t met and they don’t like the game, then the product will fail. I approached the software design
aggressively, in my opinion. I looked at what the company is looking for and did research on exactly what to expect from design constraints of such a task. Also investigated a
lot of different articles regarding operating systems from both spectrums of opinions and deduced what would be best and worst from the information gained. As Sun Tzu once
stated, know your enemy, I feel like that’s how my approach to this software design was. I wanted to gather as much information about all the systems as I could before making a
calculated decision on what is best for the company.
